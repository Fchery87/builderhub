# **🎯 FOUNDER'S PROJECT VISION**

This file is the single source of truth for the initial project scope.  
The Executive Agent will read this and use it to drive the entire process.

## **1\. Primary Goals**

* Create a real-time, collaborative task board for team sprints.  
* Ensure all task status updates are instantly reflected for all connected users.  
* Integrate the Gemini API to automatically generate acceptance criteria for new tasks based on a simple description.  
* Achieve a 99.9% uptime for the API backend.

## **2\. Target Users & Use Cases**

* **Who are the users?** Internal Development Team (Developers, Project Managers, QA Team).  
* **What is the core user interaction?** They need to view a list of open tasks, update their status (To Do, In Progress, Done), and quickly create new tasks.

## **3\. Technical Constraints & Stack**

* **Frontend Framework:** Next.js, React  
* **Backend Framework:** FastAPI, Python  
* **Database/Auth:** InstantDB  
* **AI Models:** Gemini 2.5 Flash for Orchestration, Gemini 2.5 Pro for Code Generation, Gemini 2.5 Flash for Task Acceptance Criteria generation.  
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## **4\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Scalability:** Must support up to 25 concurrent users daily.  
* **Performance:** All CRUD operations must complete in under 500ms.  
* **Security:** Requires role-based access control (RBAC) defined in the InstantDB schema (e.g., only Project Managers can delete tasks).
